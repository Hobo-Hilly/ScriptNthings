# This is an example of a for loop. ( For loops iterate through a list of things for    us. Anytime we want to itterate through a list of things we want to use this for    mat. The items in the array are very contextual. i.e. you can create an array co    ntaining anything you want and this formula will iterate through them. And stop     when it is complete.

var1 = [1, 2, 3]  # Declaring variables in an array.

for i in var1:  # This is declairing another variable with in the array labeld 'var1'               Variable 'i'
    
    print i    # Here is where we print 'i'. 'i' is the first argument/object inside                of the variable 'var1'. Which in this case is 1. Then 2. Then 3. It                 will count out (itterate) the array until it is exhausted.
