# This is a function called 'load' I have never heard of it before. Lets see what it does. You will find examples with in this folder.

# This is conditional logic. Should I do this or should I do that? How do I make a decision; one or the other.

#	- Could be a condition that needs to be met
#	- Could be the input from a user
#	- Could be from a file

# The script needs to make a decision. We need to create the defining characteristics of the script that will help it make that decision. Left or Right Up or Down etc. 

# FF: A loop iterates. and an 'If' statement makes a decision. Based off of a value or a statements/ condtions. If the statements/conditions are correct or satisfied then the 'If' statement will be the block of code that is executed.
