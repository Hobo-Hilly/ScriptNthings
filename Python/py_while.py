var1 = 0  # Declaring a variable and setting it equal to zero
while var1 < 10:   # The start of the while 'condition' that needs to be satisfied
    # condition is: while var1 remains less than 10.
    # orr as long as the variable that comes back from the end of the execution of t    he script is less than 10.. you need to do this... i.e. whatever is stated afte    r the ':' colon.
    
    var1 += 1   # counting mechanism that says add one to var1 every time one is passed to you.
    print var1 # This says print whatever the variable is now at this point. After                  having had one added to it.

# FF: the print function is a great way to debug your code and to let you know whats going on with it. Where it's failing, when it's failing, why can help you determin why it is failing.
